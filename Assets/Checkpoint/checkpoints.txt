At an altitude of 21.5 meters, the lander separated from the backshell, falling and then bouncing in its encasing balloons to a rest on the ground, where the balloons were deflated. This successful entry, descent, and landing strategy became the model for future MSL rovers. The lander opened its petals revealing solar panels and the Sojourner rover. The lander conducted imaging and meteorology studies, and acted as a communications relay for the Sojourner rover.",
